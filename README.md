# Introduction to React
This is a basic project I've used to understand React. Topics learned include:
 - State vs Props
 - Presentation vs Container Components
 - Single Responsibility Principle in React Components
 - Event handlers

Application consists of name and message input fields that will dynamically update a corresponding greeting message.

This is an ongoing learning experience - more to come.
