# Introduction to React
This is a basic project I've used to understand React. Topics learned include:
 - State vs Props
 - Presentation vs Container Components
 - Single Responsibility Principle in React Components
 - Event handlers
 - Bundling static modules using webpack

Application consists of name and message input fields that will dynamically update a corresponding greeting message.

To run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/herman-ho/hello-react.git
cd hello-react
npm install
webpack
node server.js
```
This is an ongoing learning experience - more to come.
